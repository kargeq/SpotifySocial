# Spotify Social

## Project Description
Spotify Social is an application used to connect Spotify listeners around the world. By logging into your Spotify account through our app, you are agreeing that I can access your listening history, including liked songs, top songs, and top artists. Once logged in, Spotify Social is a place where you can view summaries of your own listening history, as well as explore other peoples’. For anyone who has a public account (which is editable on your profile page), they will be displayed on the Discover page, where other users can see your liked songs, top songs, and top artists. I have also added more social features to the application, such as a Forums page, where people can create forums, as well as create and interact with posts on specific forums. Additionally, I have added a chat feature where you can directly message other users of the application. Overall, the purpose of this app was to make Spotify a more connected experience and to allow for people to connect based on their music choices, which is a space that has been empty for too long now.

### Installation
In the reactSpotify directory:

Since the app is still in development mode, there are a few extra steps needed to set up.
1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and log in with your spotify account
2. Click on the ‘create app’ button and set a name and description for your app (you can leave the ‘website’ field blank)
3. In the redirect URI, put “http://localhost:5173” (without quotes) and save the app
4. After you save the app, click on settings in the top right followed by edit at the bottom
5. Add “http://localhost:3000/spotify/callback” (without quotes) to the redirect URI
6. Copy down the client ID and client secret and save the app
7. In the backend directory, add a .env file that has the following two lines of code:

    CLIENT_ID = the client ID you copied down from the app <br/>
    CLIENT_SECRET = the client secret you copied down from the app <br/>
    #### Example .env file: <br/>
    CLIENT_ID = dacb9382e8c09a8f <br/>
    CLIENT_SECRET = djskfjl329n210n40nensk8201j<br/>
To setup the google firebase:

3. Create a firestore database within the project you just created (put it in test mode while still in development)
4. Go to settings -> project settings -> service accounts and click ‘generate a new private key’
5. Take the file that was just downloaded, rename it to ‘permissions.json’, and move it to the backend folder of the code.

### How to Use
On the login page, click the button to link your Spotify account. After logging in through Spotify, you will automatically be redirected to the landing page, where you can click the button to continue to the app. You will be taken to your profile page, where you can use the toggle switch to change between a private and public account. To view the different main pages of the app, use the buttons on the navigation bar, or in the hamburger menu if you are in mobile view. These buttons will take you to the different main pages of the app, but some of these pages have other pages you can access from them.On the discover page, click a user’s card to see their public profile, including their liked songs, top songs, and top artists. On your Top Tracks and Top Artist pages, click the different buttons to filter different time ranges. On the Forums page, click on a forum to view its posts and add posts to that specific forum. On the chat page, click on the “+” icon at the top to start a new chat or click on the boxes on the left hand side to change which chat you are currently viewing.

### Status of Features
Currently, all features are fully functional, with the minor exception of the chat page. I am working on fixing a bug where creating a new chat doesn’t display the first message until the page is refreshed.
